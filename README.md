# URL, Inc.

URL, Inc. is a small Chrome Browser extension that allows for easy navigation through sequential URLs.

If the URL of the active tab ends in a number, the extension can be used to increment/decrement this value by 1 and load the next/previous page in the sequence.

Decrement is mapped to `Ctrl + K`.
Increment is mapped to `Ctrl + L`.
